# Amaro

Amaro is a wrapper around `@swc/wasm-typescript`, a WebAssembly port of the SWC TypeScript parser.
It's currently used as an internal in Node.js for [Type Stripping](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/208), but can also be upgraded separately by users.

> Amaro means "bitter" in Italian. It's a reference to [Mount Amaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Amaro_(Abruzzo)) on whose slopes this package was conceived.

## How to Install

To install Amaro, run:

```shell
npm install -g amaro
```
